 * This function initializes a framegrabber with a given applet. Both standard applets as well
 * as VisualApplets generated HAP files are supported. The BoardIndex parameter is used to address
 * multiple framegrabbers in the same system.
 *
 * Board numbers depend on the system architecture and operating system. In general the board numbers
 * depend on the PCI setup, i.e. boards with lower PCI bus and slot numbers will have lower board
 * numbers. On Windows systems meIII grabbers will always get lower numbers than meIV devices. On
 * Linux the order depends only on the PCI bus numbers, resulting in meIII devices usually appearing
 * on higher device numbers as PCI busses are usually the last child bus of PCI Express bridges. The
 * easiest way to find out the mapping from boards to their board id is using microDiagnostics which
 * shows board type, serial number, and board index.
 *
 * A grabber that is initialized in "master" mode will configure the FPGA. A grabber initialized as
 * slave will not configure the FPGA. In fact it checks if the FPGA is already configured with the
 * same design as requested. Not all applets and platforms support slave configurations, e.g. currently
 * VA generated HAPs, mE4AD1-CL boards, and mE4AS1-CL boards do not support slave mode.
 *
 * A grabber initialized as slave has access to all resources of the board. Locking for concurrent
 * accesses is left to the user to allow maximum flexibility. On the other hand some special resources
 * will always protect themself against concurrent usage, e.g DMA channels can't be started if they are
 * already running.
 *
 * A board can only be opened in slave mode if the master is already opened, otherwise the error code
 * is set to #FG_NOT_AVAILABLE ( #FG_INVALID_PARAMETER , if slave modes isn't supported at all for this applet)
 *
 * An initialized frame grabber resource by Fg_InitEx() must be released by Fg_FreeGrabber().

 * \anchor  Fg_registerApcHandler
 * 
 * \param	Fg		frame grabber to use
 * \param	DmaIndex	DMA channel number to listen on
 * \param	control		control structure for APC operations
 * \param	flags		how to handle the control structure
 *
 * \returns	#FG_OK						if the handler was successfully registered, error code otherwise.
 * \retval	#FG_NOT_INIT				Fg is NULL
 * \retval	#FG_INVALID_PORT_NUMBER		DmaIndex is invalid
 * \retval	#FG_INVALID_PARAMETER		One parameter or the combination of parameters is invalid
 * \retval	#FG_ALREADY_STARTED			an APC handler for this DMA channel is already registered
 * \retval	#FG_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY		creation of the internal control structures or the worker thread failed
 * \retval	#FG_APC_PRIORITY_ERROR		the control structure requested #FG_APC_HIGH_PRIORITY but setting the priority failed
 * \retval	#FG_ACCESS_DENIED			setting the Priority fails due to insufficient permissions
 * \retval	#FG_APC_ALREADY_REGISTERED	an APC handler is already registered
 *
 * This function registers an APC (asynchronous procedure call) handler to be called once
 * images on the given DMA channel arrive.
 *
 \verbatim
   This function does not start the acquisition itself, this needs to be done using
   Fg_Acquire() or Fg_AcquireEx(). If an APC handler is registered for a DMA channel you
   can not use Fg_getLastPicNumberBlocking() or Fg_getLastPicNumberBlockingEx() to wait
   for images on that channel. The DMA channel will not be stopped by the APC handler
   thread on any circumstances even when the handler will terminate itself by those.\endverbatim
 *
 * Once the DMA is started the APC handler function will get called for new images. The
 * exact behaviour can be controlled by setting the flags member of the control struct
 * using the constants defined in enum #Fg_Apc_Flag in fgrab_define.h. If you are unsure
 * just pass Fg_Apc_Flag::FG_APC_DEFAULTS here.
 *
 * The handler function is stored as func in the control struct. It will be called with the
 * image number to work on as first and the value given for data in the control struct as
 * second argument.
 * \see struct fg_apc_data
 *
 * If you request #FG_APC_HIGH_PRIORITY through the flag member of the control structure,
 * your application must have the necessary privileges to change the thread scheduling and priority.
 * Note that on Linux this generally means you have to run the application as root or use setuid.
 *
 * The flags parameter allows future expansions of the APC operation mode. The only value
 * value currently valid is #FG_APC_CONTROL_BASIC. You must set the version number in the
 * control struct.
 *
 * If you want to unregister an APC handler for a given channel call this function as:
 * \code
 * Fg_registerApcHandler(Fg, dma, NULL, FG_APC_CONTROL_BASIC);
 * \endcode
 *
 * You must always unregister the APC handler from a DMA channel even if the APC thread
 * was automatically stopped. This will happen e.g. if a image timeout occurs and
 * Fg_Apc_Flag::FG_APC_IGNORE_TIMEOUTS was not set or if your handler function returns
 * with error code and Fg_Apc_Flag::FG_APC_IGNORE_APCFUNC_RETURN was not set. You do not
 * need to unregister the APC handler if registering failed with an error code.
